In June 2021 I became associated with a logistics-tech startup in its earliest stages and helped develop the company into a six-figure monthly recurring revenue business. During this time I have touched nearly every aspect of the development of the startup, including sales, operations, tech, and finance. I am currently the manager of the finance department at the company."
